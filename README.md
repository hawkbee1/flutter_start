# Flutter-Start with Golden Testing 🌟

A minimal Flutter starter project — enhanced with golden (visual) tests for multiple screen sizes, fonts and shadows.  
This repo documents step-by-step how to evolve a vanilla `flutter create` project into a UI-robust codebase with automated visual regression testing.

---

## 📄 Description

This project began as a simple “hello world” Flutter app (via `flutter create`).  
It evolved to include **golden testing**, allowing you to capture and compare rendered UI snapshots (widgets) across different screen sizes and configurations (fonts, shadows, icons).  

Golden tests help ensure that UI changes remain intentional, avoiding unexpected visual regressions — even after refactors, dependency updates or layout tweaks.  

Use this repo as a **learning exercise** or a **lightweight template** for starting future Flutter apps with a built-in visual testing setup.

## ✅ Why Golden Testing Matters

- Golden (visual) tests catch UI regressions that logic-based widget tests won’t catch (e.g. layout shifts, shadow/spacing anomalies, font/Icon rendering issues). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- They help maintain visual consistency across different devices and screen sizes, improving cross-device user experience. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Automated visual regression testing builds confidence: you can safely refactor, redesign, or extend your UI with a safety net.  
- For early-stage projects, it’s a lightweight way to add real quality assurance without heavy setup.

## 📦 Tech Stack & Tools

- Built with Flutter (standard `flutter create` boilerplate)  
- Uses a golden testing toolkit (e.g. golden_toolkit or similar) to run visual regression tests, including multi-device rendering, fonts & icons support. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Developed with VS Code + GitHub Copilot (agent mode, using Claude Opus 4.5) — most changes were generated by the agent, starting from a clean project.

## 🚀 Getting Started (How to run & test)

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed  
- A suitable device/emulator (or just use Flutter’s default device simulators)  

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hawkbee1/flutter_start.git
cd flutter_start
flutter pub get
